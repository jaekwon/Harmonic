NOTE: I'm open sourcing this code even though I have (temporarily?) abandoned this project.

Misc
====

* apps/sample is just an example app. it's not done.
* apps/auth is going to be done. it'll be useful.
* db/mongo is mostly experimental.

Usage
=====

Until the framework is 'released', the easiest way to get going is to just clone the entire project.

    git clone git@github.com:jaekwon/Harmonic.git myapp
    cd myapp 
    npm link .
    coffee server.coffee
    open 'localhost:8126'
